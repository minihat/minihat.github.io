 I am a first-year Engineering Science and Mechanics Ph.D. student at Penn State University studying Artificial Intelligence and Neural Engineering. My undergraduate studies were in Engineering Science. Now I work with [John Sustersic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-sustersic-94035b91/) on AI, and [Bruce Gluckman](https://sites.esm.psu.edu/wiki/research:bjg18:start) on neural engineering. My goal is to draw inspiration from brain physiology to develop new techniques in deep learning.

The fast-developing field of RNA nanotechnology requires the adoption and development of novel and faster computational approaches to modeling and characterization of RNA-based nano-objects. We report the first application of Elastic Network Modeling (ENM), a structure-based dynamics model, to RNA nanotechnology. With the use of an Anisotropic Network Model (ANM), a type of ENM, we characterize the dynamic behavior of non-compact, multi-stranded RNA-based nanocubes that can be used as nano-scale scaffolds carrying different functionalities. Modeling the nanocubes with our tool NanoTiler and exploring the dynamic characteristics of the models with ANM suggested relatively minor but important structural modifications that enhanced the assembly properties and thermodynamic stabilities. In silico and in vitro, we compared nanocubes having different numbers of base pairs per side, showing with both methods that the 10 bp-long helix design leads to more efficient assembly, as predicted computationally. We also explored the impact of different numbers of single-stranded nucleotide stretches at each of the cube corners and showed that cube flexibility simulations help explain the differences in the experimental assembly yields, as well as the measured nanomolecule sizes and melting temperatures. This original work paves the way for detailed computational analysis of the dynamic behavior of artificially designed multi-stranded RNA nanoparticles.

    <strong>OptNet: Differentiable Optimization as a Layer in Neural Networks</strong><br>
    <strong>B. Amos</strong> and J. Kolter<br>
    ICML 2017<br>
    [C1]
[<a href='javascript: none'
    onclick='$("#abs_amos2017optnetC").toggle()'>abs</a>] [<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00443' target='_blank'>pdf</a>]  [<a href='https://github.com/locuslab/optnet' target='_blank'>code</a>] <br>

<div id="abs_amos2017optnetC" style="text-align: justify; display: none" markdown="1">
This paper presents OptNet, a network architecture that integrates
optimization problems (here, specifically in the form of quadratic programs)
as individual layers in larger end-to-end trainable deep networks.
These layers encode constraints and complex dependencies
between the hidden states that traditional convolutional and
fully-connected layers often cannot capture.
In this paper, we explore the foundations for such an architecture:
we show how techniques from sensitivity analysis, bilevel
optimization, and implicit differentiation can be used to
exactly differentiate through these layers and with respect
to layer parameters;
we develop a highly efficient solver for these layers that exploits fast
GPU-based batch solves within a primal-dual interior point method, and which
provides backpropagation gradients with virtually no additional cost on top of
the solve;
and we highlight the application of these approaches in several problems.
In one notable example, we show that the method is
capable of learning to play mini-Sudoku (4x4) given just input and output games, with no a priori information about the rules of the game;
this highlights the ability of our architecture to learn hard
constraints better than other neural architectures.

    <strong>Privacy mediators: helping IoT cross the chasm</strong><br>

<div id="abs_davies2016privacyW" style="text-align: justify; display: none" markdown="1">
Unease over data privacy will retard consumer acceptance of IoT
deployments. The primary source of discomfort is a lack of user
control over raw data that is streamed directly from sensors to the
cloud. This is a direct consequence of the over-centralization of
today’s cloud-based IoT hub designs. We propose a solution that
interposes a locally-controlled software component called a privacy
mediator on every raw sensor stream. Each mediator is in the same
administrative domain as the sensors whose data is being collected, and dynamically enforces the current privacy policies of the owners
of the sensors or mobile users within the domain. This solution necessitates
a logical point of presence for mediators within the administrative
boundaries of each organization. Such points of presence
are provided by cloudlets, which are small locally-administered data
centers at the edge of the Internet that can support code mobility.
The use of cloudlet-based mediators aligns well with natural personal
and organizational boundaries of trust and responsibility.

High-data-rate sensors, such as video cameras, are becoming ubiquitous in the
Internet of Things. This article describes GigaSight, an Internet-scale
repository of crowd-sourced video content, with strong enforcement of privacy
preferences and access controls. The GigaSight architecture is a federated
system of VM-based cloudlets that perform video analytics at the edge of the
Internet, thus reducing the demand for ingress bandwidth into the cloud.
Denaturing, which is an owner-specific reduction in fidelity of video content
to preserve privacy, is one form of analytics on cloudlets. Content-based
indexing for search is another form of cloudlet-based analytics. This article
is part of a special issue on smart spaces.
